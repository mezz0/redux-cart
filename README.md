## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode and automatically opens up web browser.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make changes.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

You may also serve the build folder by running `serve -s build`

### Typescript

There has been an attempt at using typescript, it is a new ground for me so I am still in the process of learning.

### Prettier

I have also used prettier as means to format/prettify the project.

useage: `npx prettier --write .`

### Responsive design

The site is fully responsive down to mobile sizes. Not tested on all devices, just on the devices available to me.

### Material UI

I have used Material UI for simple icons, but the scope of Material UI can be expanded to input boxes and themeing the entire project.

### Styled Components

Chosen to use styled components to style the components (no global theme set).

### Redux

I have included redux to handle the state globally. I have also used redux thunk to help fetch data from the api.

### Redux Persist

I have also used redux persist to maintain the selections on page reload.

### Finally...

I would like to take this time to say thank you for giving me this challenge. It was a good learning curve and has also give me lots to learn.

Thank you.
